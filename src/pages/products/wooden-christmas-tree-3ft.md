These trees work great as decorations for anyone wanting an earthy or hand-crafted vibe. They are hand-made from pieces of pieces of wood, and have a themed centerpiece in the base.

This 3 foot tall version is a great middle ground if you can't decide what size you want.

An alternative design is also available:
